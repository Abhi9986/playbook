We have a bias for action. Teams should focus on delivering quality
software quickly, testing, learning and iterating. Best practice agile
is subjective, we aim to listen, learn and improve over every iteration.

Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban are selected at the discretion
of the team based upon their requirements. At minimum, the following
ceremonies must occur:

-   Estimations

-   Daily stand-up

-   Sprint Kick-offs (in Scrum)

-   Showcase

-   Retrospectives
